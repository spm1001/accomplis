# Todoist GTD

## Setup (do this for the user, don't ask)

**Be proactive.** If todoist isn't working, fix it — don't list commands for the user to run.

### 1. Install the CLI (if missing)

Install from the **source repo** — the marketplace cache ships no `pyproject.toml`, so a cache/`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` install fails ("does not appear to be a Python project"):
```bash
# Local clone if present, else git+https:
[ -f ~/repos/spm1001/todoist-gtd/pyproject.toml ] \
  && uv tool install ~/repos/spm1001/todoist-gtd --force --reinstall --no-cache \
  || uv tool install 'todoist-gtd @ git+https://github.com/spm1001/todoist-gtd' --force --reinstall --no-cache
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

The SessionStart hook (`ensure-todoist.sh`) already runs this logic automatically — you usually don't need to install by hand.

### 2. Authenticate

```bash
todoist doctor
```

If doctor reports no token, run `todoist auth` for setup instructions, then `todoist auth --token TOKEN` to store it (Keychain on Mac, plugin data dir on Linux). No manual env vars or shell profile edits needed.

**NEVER echo the API token back to the user.** The token is a secret.

## Overview

MCP-free Todoist integration using the official Python SDK (v4, httpx-based). Adds semantic understanding of GTD structure and outcome quality coaching on top of the CLI's data access.

**Core insight:** The CLI provides data. This skill provides meaning.

## When to Use

**IMPORTANT: Invoke this skill BEFORE making Todoist queries.** The CLI doesn't know the user's GTD structure — this skill does. Without it, you'll query wrong fields (tasks vs sections), miss context (outcomes are sections, not tasks), and produce confusing results.

**Use for:**
- ANY Todoist query or update (load this skill first for context)
- Outcome quality coaching and creation
- Weekly review / strategic reflection
- Pattern detection: overcommitment, scope creep, hero mode
- Before taking on work: "Should I take this on?"

## When NOT to Use

- Simple task creation that doesn't need GTD framing
- Quick queries where you already know the project structure

## Discovering the User's Structure

**DO NOT assume project names or team member details.** Every user's Todoist is different. Discover dynamically:

```bash
# Who am I?
todoist whoami

# What projects exist?
todoist projects

# What's the structure of a specific project?
todoist sections --project "Project Name"

# Who's on a shared project?
todoist collaborators --project-id "<id>"
```

### The Universal GTD Pattern in Todoist

Regardless of how each user names their projects, look for this structure:

| GTD Concept | Where in Todoist | How to Find |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Desired Outcomes | Sections in an outcomes project | Look for projects named like "Desired Outcomes", "Goals", "OKRs" |
| Next Actions | Tasks under outcome sections, or in context projects | Look for projects named with @ prefix or action-oriented names |
| Waiting For | Tasks in a waiting/follow-up project | Look for "@Wait", "Waiting For", or similar |
| Someday/Maybe | Tasks in a someday/backlog project | Look for "@Someday", "Someday/Maybe", or similar |
| Areas of Focus | Sections in an areas project | Look for "Areas of Focus", "Responsibilities", or similar |
| Reference | Projects for reference material | Varies by user |

### Where Outcomes Live: Discover, Don't Assume

Outcomes commonly live as **sections in an outcomes project** — but not always, and the same user may use different layouts in different projects. Discover per project by reading what the sections *are*:

```
Desired Outcomes (project)                    Projects - Toolmaking (project)
  +-- Built team capacity for... (section)      +-- Someday (section = status lane)
  |     +-- [tasks under it]                    +-- [outcomes as TASKS at root]
  +-- Established new... (section)
  = sections ARE outcomes                       = sections are STATUS LANES,
    → query with `sections`                       outcomes are tasks → query with `tasks`
```

**The discrimination test:** list a project's sections and read their names.
- Names like past-tense achievements ("Built...", "Secured...") → **sections are outcomes**
- Names like status lanes (Someday, Now/Later, To Do/Doing/Done) → **outcomes are tasks**, sections are workflow states
- No sections at all → it's a flat context or task list

Record what you find and use it for the rest of the session rather than re-deriving. When coaching a new user, the sections-as-outcomes layout is the pattern to *recommend* — but read before you write.

### Workspace vs Personal Projects

The CLI auto-detects workspace (team) projects and filters accordingly:

| Project Type | Signal | Default Behavior |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| **Personal** | No `workspace_id` | Shows all tasks (no filtering) |
| **Personal with collaborators** | Collaborators but no `workspace_id` | Shows all tasks (they're all yours) |
| **Workspace (team)** | Has `workspace_id` | Auto-filters to your tasks only |

**Flags for workspace projects:**
- Default: shows only tasks assigned to you
- `--unassigned`: shows unassigned tasks (triage mode)
- `--team`: shows all team members' tasks
- `--assignee "Name"`: shows specific person's tasks

```bash
# Your tasks on a shared project (default)
todoist tasks --project "Shared Project"

# Triage unassigned tasks
todoist tasks --project "Shared Project" --unassigned

# Everyone's tasks
todoist tasks --project "Shared Project" --team

# Specific person
todoist tasks --project "Shared Project" --assignee "Full Name"
```

### GTD Contexts Are Usually Projects

**GTD contexts (Waiting For, Work, Someday…) are usually PROJECTS, not labels.** Query with `--project`, not `--label` (unless the user genuinely uses labels).

```bash
todoist tasks --project "@Wait"           # if their contexts use an @ prefix
todoist tasks --project "& Waiting For"   # if they use an & prefix, or plain names
```

**The prefix is a per-user convention, not a rule** — `@`, `&`, emoji, or none at all. Even one user's convention changes over time. Discover it fresh: list all projects and look for the short, action-situation names (Work, Home, Waiting, Someday, Agendas) clustered under a common prefix.

## GTD Methodology

### Horizons of Focus

GTD organises commitments across six horizons. Each horizon informs the ones below it:

| Horizon | Focus | Question | Review Cadence |
|---------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **H5: Purpose** | Why do I exist in this role? | "What's my unique contribution?" | Annual |
| **H4: Vision** | What does success look like in 3-5 years? | "Where am I heading?" | Quarterly |
| **H3: Goals** | What do I want to achieve in 1-2 years? | "What milestones matter?" | Quarterly |
| **H2: Areas of Focus** | What are my ongoing responsibilities? | "Am I covering all my areas?" | Monthly |
| **H1: Projects/Outcomes** | What multi-step results am I committed to? | "What's on my plate?" | Weekly |
| **Ground: Actions** | What's the next physical action? | "What do I do right now?" | Daily |

**In Todoist mapping:**
- H1-H2 live in outcomes and areas projects
- Ground level lives in context projects (@Work, @Wait, etc.)
- H3-H5 are typically in annual/strategic projects or outside Todoist

### The Five Steps of GTD Mastery

1. **Capture** — Get everything out of your head into a trusted system
2. **Clarify** — Decide what each item is and whether it's actionable
3. **Organise** — Put things where they belong (project, context, waiting, someday)
4. **Reflect** — Review regularly (weekly review is the critical habit)
5. **Engage** — Choose what to do with confidence

### Natural Planning Model

When creating or coaching on outcomes, use this framework:

1. **Purpose** — Why are we doing this? What's the strategic reason?
2. **Vision** — What does wild success look like?
3. **Brainstorming** — What are all the ideas, concerns, loose ends?
4. **Organising** — What's the sequence? What depends on what?
5. **Next Actions** — What's the very next physical action?

**Use this when:** Creating new outcomes, reviewing stale outcomes, or when someone is stuck on "where do I start?"

### Tier 2 vs Tier 3: The Critical Distinction

**Tier 2 (Outcomes) ask:** "What do I want to have achieved?"
**Tier 3 (Projects/Actions) ask:** "What do I need to do?"

**Quick test:**
- "Write the strategy doc" -> Tier 3 (activity)
- "Team has clear Q4 direction" -> Tier 2 (achievement)

**The pattern:** Past-tense verb, describes what's *different* when done, includes the "so what".

| Activity (Tier 3) | Achievement (Tier 2) |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Write the docs | New team members can onboard within a day |
| Build rate limiter | API stays responsive under peak load |
| Attend conference | Established voice in industry discussions |
| Complete audit | Audit trail catches anomalies before users notice |

**For detailed coaching patterns and examples:** See [references/COACHING.md](references/COACHING.md)

## Terminology Disambiguation

**"Project" has 3 meanings:**

| Context | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Todoist | Container for tasks | An outcomes project |
| GTD Tier 3 | Multi-step outcome | "Launch Panel+ v2" |
| Business | Work initiative | "The migration project" |

**For full terminology guide:** See [references/TERMINOLOGY.md](references/TERMINOLOGY.md)

## CLI Query Patterns

**All commands return JSON.** Key patterns:

```bash
todoist sections --project "Outcomes Project"           # Outcomes (sections!)
todoist tasks --section-id "<outcome-id>"               # Tasks under an outcome
todoist tasks --project "@Wait" --older-than 30d        # Stale waiting-fors
todoist filter "assigned to: me"                        # Your tasks across projects
todoist tasks --project "@Work" --include-section-name  # Tasks with section context
```

**Critical:** `tasks` and `task` return complete objects with `.comments[]` inline. `filter` returns tasks only (no comments — filters can span projects).

**For full query patterns, data model, and API limitations:** see [references/CLI_REFERENCE.md](references/CLI_REFERENCE.md)

## Write Operation Guardrails

### Creating Outcomes

**BEFORE creating, use the Natural Planning Model:**
1. What's the purpose? (Why does this matter?)
2. What does success look like? (Vision of done)
3. Which area of focus does it serve?

**Outcome goes:** wherever this user's outcomes live — discover first (see "Where Outcomes Live" above), then match their layout.

```bash
# In a sections-as-outcomes project:
todoist add-section "Built team capacity through documentation" \
  --project "OUTCOMES_PROJECT"

# In a tasks-as-outcomes project (sections are status lanes):
todoist add "Built team capacity through documentation" \
  --project "OUTCOMES_PROJECT"
```

Either way, **write it as an achievement, not an activity** — that's the part that doesn't vary by user.

### Writing Next Actions (GTD Style)

**Next actions must be concrete, physical, and start with a verb describing what you'd actually do.**

Bad (vague, outcome-ish):
- "Sort out the legal stuff"
- "2026 planning"

Good (concrete, physical):
- "Read the brief and note 3 questions for the meeting"
- "Open the deck + outcomes list, draft team plan skeleton"

**The test:** "What would I actually do when I sit down to do this?"

### Entrusting Pattern (Delegation)

When delegating an outcome:

1. **Create a structured delegation doc** with: desired outcome, why, resources needed, update cadence, deadline, response options
2. **Link the doc** in the Todoist item description
3. **Create a follow-up item** in the appropriate context project
4. **Outcome stays assigned to delegator** until the conversation happens

### Completing vs Deleting Tasks

**ALWAYS complete, NEVER delete** (unless truly erroneous).

- Completed tasks preserve history for future planning
- Duplicates should be completed with a note
- Obsolete items should be completed (still counts as "resolved")

### Anti-Patterns

| Bad Practice | Why Wrong | Better |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Guessing where outcomes go | Mismatches the user's layout | Discover first, then match it |
| Tier 3 project as outcome | Inflates outcome count | Challenge: "Activity or achievement?" |
| Completing without reflection | Loses learning | Prompt for resolution notes |
| Joint ownership | No clear driver, item drifts | One owner per outcome |
| No next action on active outcome | Outcome stalls invisibly | Every active outcome needs at least one next action |

## Review Cadences

### Daily Review (~10-15 mins)

Three parts: **Clarify, Check Lists, Calendar.**

1. **Clarify** — Process inboxes to empty (email, Todoist inbox, other capture points)
2. **Check Lists** — Quick scan: agenda items for today, stale waiting-fors, projects missing next actions
3. **Calendar** — Next 7 days, agendas for today's meetings

### Weekly Review (~45-60 mins)

Three phases: **Get Current, Get Clear, Get Creative** (Peake's ordering — catch up with reality before cleaning the system).

1. **Get Current** — Mind sweep all capture points, process every inbox to zero
2. **Get Clear** — Review all projects, next actions, waiting-fors, calendar
3. **Get Creative** — Review someday/maybe, notice what's missing, generate ideas

**For the full review checklists:** See [references/GTD_METHODOLOGY.md](references/GTD_METHODOLOGY.md#stage-4-reflect)

**For pattern detection and coaching:** See [references/PATTERNS.md](references/PATTERNS.md)

## Pattern Intervention Triggers

Surface these concerns when analysing data:

**Overcommitment:**
- 5+ active outcomes -> "Can you really advance all of these?"
- All outcomes high priority -> "If everything is critical, nothing is focused"

**Strategic gaps:**
- Outcome has no tasks -> "Stuck, deprioritized, or needs rescoping?"
- No outcomes in an area of focus -> "Dormant area — intentional?"

**Staleness:**
- Outcome unchanged 4+ weeks -> "Stuck, deprioritized, or needs rescoping?"

**Quality:**
- Outcome reads like activity -> "This is what you're doing, not achieving"
- Missing success criteria -> "How will you know when it's done?"

## Claude Inbox Patterns

If the user has a Claude-specific inbox project:

1. Query it: `todoist tasks --project "@Claude"` (or whatever it's named)
2. For each item: check `.comments[]` for context
3. Decide: do now, move, or complete

See [references/PATTERNS.md](references/PATTERNS.md#inbox-triage-workflow) for the full workflow.

## Quick Reference

### Key Queries

| Query | CLI Command |
|-------|-------------|
| All projects | `todoist projects` |
| Current user | `todoist whoami` |
| Outcomes | `todoist sections --project "OUTCOMES_PROJECT"` |
| Tasks under outcome | `todoist tasks --section-id "<outcome-id>"` |
| Tasks with section names | `todoist tasks --project "X" --include-section-name` |
| Person's work | `todoist tasks --project "X" --assignee "Name"` |
| Unassigned (triage) | `todoist tasks --project "X" --unassigned` |
| Stale waiting-fors | `todoist tasks --project "@Wait" --older-than 30d` |
| Today's tasks | `todoist filter "today"` |

### Key Write Operations

| Operation | CLI Command |
|-----------|-------------|
| Create outcome | `todoist add-section "name" --project "OUTCOMES_PROJECT"` |
| Create task | `todoist add "content" --project "PROJECT" --section "SECTION"` |
| Complete task | `todoist done "<task-id>"` |
| Rename task | `todoist update "<task-id>" --content "new name"` |
| Move to project | `todoist update "<task-id>" --project "PROJECT"` |
| Move to section | `todoist update "<task-id>" --section "SECTION"` |
| Move OUT of section | `todoist update "<task-id>" --no-section` |
| Arrange a queue | `todoist reorder <id1> <id2> <id3>` (order = sequence given) |

**Note:** Replace `OUTCOMES_PROJECT`, `PROJECT`, `SECTION` with the user's actual project/section names discovered via `todoist projects` and `todoist sections`.

## Remember

**The CLI is plumbing. This skill is meaning.**

- Discover structure dynamically — never assume project names, prefixes, or where outcomes live
- Outcomes are usually sections, sometimes tasks — read the sections to tell which
- "Project" means different things in different contexts
- Challenge activity language -> frame as achievement
- Surface patterns, not just data
- Use horizons of focus for strategic context
- Use natural planning model for outcome creation
